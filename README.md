# Welcome to the CSn wiki!

Wiki and code repository for my CS0, CS1, and CS2 classes

This repo contains my course notes and source code for the CS0, CS1, and CS2 classes I teach at Normandale Community College, in Bloomington, MN.  This is, and will probably forever remain, a work in progress.

# Table of Contents

Here is the breakdown of topics, by course.  Note that this is not a hard-and-fast breakdown; there are some semesters in which I may choose to incorporate some CS1 topics into CS0 or CS2, or introduce some CS2 topics into CS1.
