This web site is highly influenced by the following references, some of which just happen to be the textbooks
I use for CS0, CS1, and CS2.

* *Algorithms, 4th Edition*, by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne

* *Introduction to Programming in Java*, by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne

*Algorithms, 4th Edition* is the only book I would ever consider using for teaching a freshman/sophomore
data structures and algorithms course.  The influence of this book can be seen throughout the CS2 portion of this site,
and somewhat in the CS1 topics as well.

*Introduction to Programming in Java* is also available in a Python version.

If Dr. Sedgewick and Dr. Wayne ever stumble across this site, I do hope they accept the imitation they see here as,
indeed, the sincerest form of flattery.


* *Head First Learn to Code*, by Eric Freeman

This is an excellent book for learning to code using Python.  I like it despite O'Reilly's annoying policy of not providing
free desk copies to instructors.

* *Fundamental Programming Concepts*, by Frank Vahid

This is a very good web-based text from zyBooks.  It steps the student through the basic CS0 topics using a very simple
(too simple?) language the author invented for the book, called Coral.  The only drawback for me is that it is very
flowchart based, and I do have a "thing" against flowcharts.  But this book does flowcharts in a very controlled way
that makes them palatable to me.
