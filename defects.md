# That's not a bug...

I'm on a one-man crusade
to eliminate the word "bug"
from our vocabulary.
It's a cutesy word
with a cute and humorous history,
and I think using it makes it too easy
to ignore software problems.

I suggest we start calling "bugs"
what they really are: defects.
There's a difference in tone
between being told there's a
bug in your code,
versus being told there's a defect in it.
Worse yet,
consider the difference in tone
between "buggy code"
and "defective code".
The latter has a far more serious sound,
and I think it's time we use it
and start treating
software problems more seriously
than we currently do,
starting with teaching students
about the relatively simple techniques
they can use to analyze code for
correctness.

So:

# That's not a bug...it's a defect.
