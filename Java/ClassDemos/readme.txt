To run the Show*Sort programs, download the algs4.jar file from

    https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/algs4.jar

and compile as, for example:

    javac -cp .;algs4.jar ShowHeapSort.java

The HashAnalysis program requires the CSn.jar file.  To
generate that, open the ../CSn folder, open a Java file
to force it to load Java projects, and in the Java
projects section select Rebuild All and Export Jar.
For the Export Jar dialog, select 'bin' as the
files to add (not JUnit or the other one that will
be listed).
