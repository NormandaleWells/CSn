# C++ rants

My main complaint about C++
is that it has become so large.
It's become the Microsoft Word
of languages -- nobody ever needs
all the features,
but every feature is absolutely
essential to someone's work.

This makes teaching C++ particularly hard.
It is impossible to teach the entire language
in a single semester,
so it is necessary to pick a subset
to teach.
It would really great if the C++ community
could agree on a standard subset
that could be taught in a single
semester, and maybe a second subset that
a two-semester course could cover.
